          <h1 class="text-center">Meet Rithy Voeun of Kolache Boss in Katy</h1>
      <p class="text-justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family and I immigrated from Cambodia to escape war and starvation in 1984. We originally lived in Nashville, TN until my father was injured at work and permanently damaged his hand.
        My parents then decided to load up seven kids in a station wagon and all the belongings that we could fit on the roof and moved to Philadelphia, PA to find work and a supportive community of Cambodian refugees. My siblings and I (Rithy) grew up in the streets of South Philadelphia and eventually, all seven of us graduated from high school there.

        My oldest brother, Sam, was the first to graduate from high school and I, being the fifth of seven children, ended up being the third to graduate from high school and eventually the first to graduate from a university with the help of a full scholarship.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My brother, Sam, was the trailblazer in the family. He moved to Houston, Texas, over twenty years ago, to start his family as well as look for opportunities for growth. I followed him to Texas after getting my B.S. and have been here for twelve years working as an elementary school teacher.
        
        After years of working as a web technician for Harris County, Sam decided that he wanted to be his own boss and improve his lifestyle. He quit his job and then started a small donut shop in Brookshire, where he worked seven days a week for many years, without taking sick days and vacation days. Sam would often consult with me about new recipes and testing out his creations as well and inviting me to start a business with him. One day he sampled some kolaches at a very popular chain and was disappointed in the quality of their product and noticed that the bread was dry.
        
        He said to me, “My bread is softer and tastes better. I can create something more, gourmet.” I agreed with him and that was how the idea of Kolache Boss was born.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, has it been relatively smooth? If not, what were some of the struggles along the way?
        Starting a new business isn’t easy, especially when funds are limited, and there’s a lot of permits to obtain as well as government red tape. Our biggest challenge was finding the right people to bake and sell the goods as well as maintaining the equipment and keeping up to code. We have successfully managed to work out all the kinks and are happy that any obstacles were just small hiccups.<br></p></div>
