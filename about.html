          <h1 class="text-center">Meet Rithy Voeun of Kolache Boss in Katy</h1>
      <p>My family and I immigrated from Cambodia to escape war and starvation in 1984. We originally lived in Nashville, TN until my father was injured at work and permanently damaged his hand.
        My parents then decided to load up seven kids in a station wagon and all the belongings that we could fit on the roof and moved to Philadelphia, PA to find work and a supportive community of Cambodian refugees. My siblings and I (Rithy) grew up in the streets of South Philadelphia and eventually, all seven of us graduated from high school there.

        My oldest brother, Sam, was the first to graduate from high school and I, being the fifth of seven children, ended up being the third to graduate from high school and eventually the first to graduate from a university with the help of a full scholarship. My brother, Sam, was the trailblazer in the family. He moved to Houston, Texas, over twenty years ago, to start his family as well as look for opportunities for growth. I followed him to Texas after getting my B.S. and have been here for twelve years working as an elementary school teacher.
        
        After years of working as a web technician for Harris County, Sam decided that he wanted to be his own boss and improve his lifestyle. He quit his job and then started a small donut shop in Brookshire, where he worked seven days a week for many years, without taking sick days and vacation days. Sam would often consult with me about new recipes and testing out his creations as well and inviting me to start a business with him. One day he sampled some kolaches at a very popular chain and was disappointed in the quality of their product and noticed that the bread was dry.
        
        He said to me, “My bread is softer and tastes better. I can create something more, gourmet.” I agreed with him and that was how the idea of Kolache Boss was born.
        
        Overall, has it been relatively smooth? If not, what were some of the struggles along the way?
        Starting a new business isn’t easy, especially when funds are limited, and there’s a lot of permits to obtain as well as government red tape. Our biggest challenge was finding the right people to bake and sell the goods as well as maintaining the equipment and keeping up to code. We have successfully managed to work out all the kinks and are happy that any obstacles were just small hiccups.
        
        Kolache Boss – what should we know? What do you guys do best? What sets you apart from the competition?
        Since we opened in July 2016, we have many loyal and repeat customers, who tell us how tasty and soft our kolaches are. We serve fruit and breakfast kolaches as well as specialty ones, such as the Philly Cheesesteak, in honor of our childhood home. In addition, we sell delicious cinnamon rolls and have recently added donuts for the kids (and adults) with a sweet tooth. I saw one customer try a kolache for the first time and said, “Oh, my, I wasn’t expecting it to be this soft and this good!”
        
        That is the best compliment for our business. Every kolache is handmade right here in the shop and baked fresh daily. Because of the support of our community and great customers, we have been very successful and are looking to expand in Katy. We have also gotten requests to open one in California, New York, and Philadelphia. Yes, our customers come from all over and stop by our shop when visiting with family or traveling for work in Texas.
        
        What is “success” or “successful” for you?
        Like any business, money matters, but it’s not the only thing that matters. We like having repeat customers as well as being a positive influence in the community. During Hurricane Harvey, we donated to Powerhouse Church and provided breakfast for the volunteers cleaning up Katy. We like to connect with our community and our customers and hope in return they will be loyal to us.</p></div>
